# Pixelation Toon Shader Demo

Hello, and welcome to the repository!

This demo is my first attempt at using 2D Textures, Shader Graphs and really anything to do with the Unity Render Pipeline.

## What is happening!?!?

It's really simple. 

1. First we apply our shader to a material that we apply to the shapes in our scene.
2. Next, we use the camera view as input for our Texture, which has a lower resolution that is scaled to screen size.

That's really it. The Shader Graph is the Toon Shader, and the Texture is the pixelated view.

Feel free to use however you'd like :)
